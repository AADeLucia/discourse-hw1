# Deep Learning for Automated Discourse
# Assignment 1: Alexa Skill

## Description
We created a "Mimic Skill" with multiple custom intents:

1. A ``mimic`` intent where Alexa repeats what the user said back to the user
2. A ``hello`` intent where Alexa says "Hello" back to the user
3. A cute joke ``stop`` intent

And for fun we made it sassy.

## Example Discourse
Open Mimic Skill
``
``Hello, there!``
